So already we have simplified the list, and made it much easier / less intimidating to handle:

Persistent Cross-Site Scripting & Session Hijacking
.NET Deserialization
Bypassing File Extension Filters & Bypassing File Upload Restrictions
PostgreSQL Extension and User Defined Functions
Bypassing REGEX restrictions & Bypassing Character Restrictions
Cross-Site Request Forgery
Blind SQL Injection & Data Exfiltration
Loose Comparisons, Type Juggling & Magic Hashes
PostgreSQL Large Objects
Debugging .NET Assemblies
Now I personally have already dealt with some of these vulnerabilities before, so less time will be required for me to look over them (I did the same thing in OSCP, order by what I thought would take me the longest to master, and start from there), so here is my ordered list of what I think will take me the most time, to the least time (I have also included a personally expected difficulty level out of 10):

.NET Deserialization (7/10)
Debugging .NET Assemblies (6/10)
PostgreSQL Extension and User Defined Functions (6/10)
PostgreSQL Large Objects (6/10)
Blind SQL Injection & Data Exfiltration (5/10)
Bypassing REGEX restrictions & Bypassing Character Restrictions (4/10)
Loose Comparisons, Type Juggling & Magic Hashes (4/10)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (3/10)
Bypassing File Extension Filters & Bypassing File Upload R
